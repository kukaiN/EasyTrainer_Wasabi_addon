## EasyTrainer_Wasabi_addon
 Small changes to the kohya backend and Easytrainer frontend that adds features to easy trainer.

 You will need to install Lora_EasyTrainer first. (I recommend the dev branch, instructions below).

This is the specific version of EasyTrainer I am using (it's the latest version available, when I'm writing this, 7/10/24).
https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/tree/80e2c49


# Instructions:

1. Downloading Derrian's Easy trainer:
 You can get the latest dev version with: git clone -b dev https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts

 Then do the basic installing for Derrian EasyTrainer.

2. Then come back to this repo, download the zip or git clone this repo anywhere u like: git clone https://github.com/kukaiN/EasyTrainer_Wasabi_addon

3. go into the downloaded repo and copy everything in the changes folder. Then paste it inside the Easytrainer folder. It'll ask you if you want to replace ~7 files, and once you replaced the files the files are properly updated to the same one I'm using.

4. Then you should have a new file "install_matplotlib.bat" in the easytrainer folder, click it to additionally install matplotlib in the Kohya backend.

Instalization is complete, you start the app normally with the "run.bat"
